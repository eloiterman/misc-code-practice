coding practice -basic stuff
 
 This is where I'm going to back up some practice excercises I have done in my learning history
 
 There are some basic code problems here 
 -word counts
 -check for repeated words
 -prime number
 -reverse words
 -check if it's a palendrome
 
 -practice with objects and arrays 
 
 The "tech_test_master" was a take home test for a job that took me time to complete  for further reference and practice as needed.
